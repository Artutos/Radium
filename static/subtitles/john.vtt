5
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.094
I do hope
that Mr. Wick

6
00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:02.963
finds his way to safety.

7
00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:05.131
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

8
00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.601
And killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

9
00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:09.703
Do you expect him
to make it out?

10
00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:11.571
$14 million bounty
on his head.

11
00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:15.174
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

12
00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:17.746
I'd say the odds
are about even.

13
00:03:35.764 --> 00:03:38.163
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

14
00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:39.332
No way!

15
00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:42.636
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

16
00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:44.671
But I know better, man.

17
00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:46.509
I know better.
I know what I'm...

18
00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:55.948
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

19
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.486
Tick tock.

20
00:03:57.953 --> 00:03:59.685
Tick tock.

21
00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:02.989
Tick tock. Tick...

22
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:05.127
No time to dilly-dally,
Mr. Wick!

24
00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:22.845
You got it.

25
00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:43.733
Change of plan.

26
00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:48.134
To the Continental.

27
00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:50.907
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

28
00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.642
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

29
00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:58.213

It's almost up. Who's gonna
know the difference?

43
00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:13.413
You sure this is what
you wanna do?

44
00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.281

It's a lot of money.

45
00:07:15.283 --> 00:07:16.352
Not if you can't spend it.

Oh, shit.

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:07.733
Know what?

92
00:13:07.735 --> 00:13:10.105
I told you
where the medicine was.

93
00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:28.653
- Where?
- Here.

94
00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:29.855

Oh, wait!

97
00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:37.566
One may not be enough.

98
00:13:41.535 --> 00:13:43.538
Yeah. All right.

99
00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:46.405
Be sure not to graze my...

100
00:13:46.407 --> 00:13:48.576
Oh!

101
00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:57.418

- Yes, let's go.

104
00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:01.800
Open the door.

105
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.288
Shoot the lock.

106

- Its him.
- Yes.

107
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.600

111
00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:00.055
We are closed.

112
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.498
Look who it is.

113
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.795
And the belt.

114
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.292
Take him to her.

115
00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.860

Again!

119
00:25:57.136 --> 00:26:01.542
Jardani.
Why have you come home?

120
00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:09.614
You present this to me
like an answer.

121
00:26:09.616 --> 00:26:11.985
I still have my ticket.

122
00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:16.488
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

123
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.990
you think
your ticket is valid?

124
00:26:18.992 --> 00:26:21.159
You forget
that the Ruska Roma

125
00:26:21.161 --> 00:26:23.061
is bound by the High Table,

126
00:26:23.063 --> 00:26:26.331
and the High Table
stands above all?

127
00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:28.536
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

128
00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:35.175
You honor me by bringing death
to my front door.

129
00:26:37.044 --> 00:26:41.216
Oh, Jardani,
what has become of you?

130
00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:46.836
I am Jardani Jovonovich.

131
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.133
I am a child of the Belarus.

132
00:26:51.134 --> 00:26:55.000
An orphan of your tribe.

133
00:26:55.001 --> 00:26:58.320
You are bound to help me.

134
00:26:59.432 --> 00:27:01.499
You are bound...

135
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:04.038
And I am owed.

136
00:27:08.474 --> 00:27:10.144
Rooney, enough!

137
00:27:19.036 --> 00:27:20.271
Follow me.

138
00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:44.543
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

139
00:27:44.545 --> 00:27:46.745
You know, when my pupils
first come here,

140
00:27:46.747 --> 00:27:48.513
they wish for one thing.

141
00:27:48.515 --> 00:27:51.083
A life free of suffering.

142
00:27:51.085 --> 00:27:53.684
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

143
00:27:53.686 --> 00:27:55.956
but as you know,

144
00:27:56.723 --> 00:27:58.225
art is pain.

145
00:28:01.627 --> 00:28:03.630
Life is suffering.

146
00:28:08.568 --> 00:28:11.038
Somehow,
you managed to get out.

147
00:28:12.138 --> 00:28:14.308
But here you are,
back where you began.

148
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:17.478
All of this, for what?

149
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.729
For a dog?

150
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.800
It wasn't just a dog.

151
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.300
Bringing back old memories?

152
00:28:54.347 --> 00:28:55.613
Pirouette.

153
00:28:57.317 --> 00:28:59.750
Pirouette, pirouette.

154
00:29:02.556 --> 00:29:03.636
Sit.

155
00:29:17.336 --> 00:29:22.175
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

156
00:29:23.143 --> 00:29:25.380
The High Table
wants your life.

157
00:29:26.212 --> 00:29:29.113
How can you fight the wind?

158
00:29:29.115 --> 00:29:30.681
How can you smash
the mountains?

159
00:29:30.683 --> 00:29:33.351
How can you bury the ocean?

160
00:29:33.353 --> 00:29:36.087
How can you escape
from the light?

161
00:29:36.089 --> 00:29:38.657
Of course,
you can go to the dark.

162
00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:40.661
But they're in the dark, too.

163
00:29:43.329 --> 00:29:48.301
So tell me, Jardani.
What do you really want?

164
00:29:50.871 --> 00:29:52.240
Passage.

165
00:29:53.606 --> 00:29:55.076
Where did you want to go?

166
00:29:56.742 --> 00:29:58.612
Casablanca.

167
00:30:00.547 --> 00:30:03.617
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

168
00:30:09.123 --> 00:30:10.555
So be it.

169
00:30:10.557 --> 00:30:14.362
You hand me your ticket,
I will tear it.

170
00:30:15.496 --> 00:30:17.632
If that's what
you really desire.

171
00:30:57.203 --> 00:31:00.607
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

172
00:31:10.349 --> 00:31:12.352
You can never come home again.

173
00:31:14.488 --> 00:31:15.890
Take him to the lifeboat.

174
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.758
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

175
00:31:21.694 --> 00:31:23.563
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

176
00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:57.565
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

177
00:32:15.882 --> 00:32:20.654
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

178
00:32:22.489 --> 00:32:23.591
Very well, sir.

179
00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.796
The manager is in the lounge.

180
00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:37.568
I presume you're
here to discuss John Wick.

181
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.005
If that's so,
we can make this short.

182
00:32:40.007 --> 00:32:43.674
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

183
00:32:43.676 --> 00:32:45.212
And that's the all of it.

184
00:32:46.012 --> 00:32:47.545
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

185
00:32:47.547 --> 00:32:49.814
Oh, yes.

186
00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:51.949
And I haven't got the
slightest idea where he is...

187
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:53.317
You're mistaken.

188
00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:55.019
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

189
00:32:55.021 --> 00:32:57.689
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

190
00:32:57.691 --> 00:32:59.024
- Hmm.
- The blood was spilt

191
00:32:59.026 --> 00:33:01.492
on the grounds of
the Continental. Was it not?

192
00:33:01.494 --> 00:33:02.661
Oh, yes.

193
00:33:02.663 --> 00:33:04.929
As a matter of fact,
the body gets colder

194
00:33:04.931 --> 00:33:06.864
within these very walls.

195
00:33:06.866 --> 00:33:09.269
I'd like to see it.

196
00:33:36.962 --> 00:33:39.898
Santino D'Antonio.

197
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.033
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

198
00:33:42.035 --> 00:33:42.968
slain by Mr. Wick

199
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.274
while seeking sanctuary
in the Continental.

200
00:33:50.443 --> 00:33:53.978
With a .45 ACP,
it appears.

201
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.914
I had no control
over Mr. Wick's actions.

202
00:33:56.916 --> 00:33:59.786
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

203
00:34:00.619 --> 00:34:01.619
Yes.

204
00:34:01.621 --> 00:34:03.988
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

205
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.294
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

206
00:34:07.527 --> 00:34:09.661
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

207
00:34:09.663 --> 00:34:11.595
you stood by
and let him walk away

208
00:34:11.597 --> 00:34:13.998
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

209
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.034
I made him Excommunicado.

210
00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:19.003
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

211
00:34:19.005 --> 00:34:20.704
He broke the rules
in my hotel.

212
00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:23.374
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

213
00:34:23.376 --> 00:34:25.744
Where is your fealty?

214
00:34:25.746 --> 00:34:27.912
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

215
00:34:27.914 --> 00:34:30.081
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

216
00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:31.916
Everything is under the Table.

217
00:34:31.918 --> 00:34:33.650
I understand
that you have your loyalties,

218
00:34:33.652 --> 00:34:34.985
but this cannot be overlooked.

219
00:34:34.987 --> 00:34:38.655
Let me be clear.
I am here to adjudge you.

220
00:34:38.657 --> 00:34:40.497
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

221
00:34:41.827 --> 00:34:42.994
Excuse me?

222
00:34:42.996 --> 00:34:45.833
At such time,
your successor will be named.

223
00:34:47.634 --> 00:34:49.166
There are rules,

224
00:34:49.168 --> 00:34:50.901
they are the only things
that separate us...

225
00:34:50.903 --> 00:34:53.438
- From the animals.
- Yes.

226
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.108
You have seven days.

227
00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:02.146
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

228
00:35:02.148 --> 00:35:05.016
you may look for me
in room 217.

229
00:35:05.018 --> 00:35:08.054
Enjoy your stay
at the Continental.

230
00:35:21.134 --> 00:35:23.737
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

231
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.985
Welcome to my Mission Control.

232
00:35:40.987 --> 00:35:44.521
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

233
00:35:44.523 --> 00:35:46.791
From whence I control
the word on the street,

234
00:35:46.793 --> 00:35:47.992
the way of the world.

235
00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:49.526
With pigeons.

236
00:35:49.528 --> 00:35:53.501
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

237
00:35:54.768 --> 00:35:58.702
No IP addresses.
No digital footprint.

238
00:35:58.704 --> 00:36:02.507
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

239
00:36:02.509 --> 00:36:05.108
Can you get disease from it?

240
00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.614
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

241
00:36:08.547 --> 00:36:10.682
What the hell do you want?

242
00:36:10.684 --> 00:36:12.650
I wanted to see
where it didn't happen.

243
00:36:12.652 --> 00:36:14.251
Where what didn't happen?

244
00:36:14.253 --> 00:36:16.022
Where you didn't kill
John Wick.

245
00:36:17.123 --> 00:36:18.222
I've always been
under the impression

246
00:36:18.224 --> 00:36:21.626
that contracts and
executing them was optional.

247
00:36:21.628 --> 00:36:23.631
I have no problem
with John Wick.

248
00:36:29.835 --> 00:36:33.505
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

249
00:36:33.507 --> 00:36:35.039
knowing that
he intended to use it

250
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:36.911
to stand against the Table.
Yes?

251
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.083
This Kimber 1911,
to be exact.

252
00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:53.224
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

253
00:36:53.226 --> 00:36:56.059
the High Table
is giving you seven days.

254
00:36:56.061 --> 00:36:58.563
Seven days for what, exactly?

255
00:36:58.565 --> 00:36:59.831
To settle your affairs

256
00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:02.166
and find a new home
for your birds.

257
00:37:02.168 --> 00:37:04.738
In seven days,
you abdicate your throne.

258
00:37:17.016 --> 00:37:18.182
Oh, my dear.

259
00:37:18.184 --> 00:37:21.084
Tell me, do you know what
the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

260
00:37:21.086 --> 00:37:23.787
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

261
00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:27.157
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

262
00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:29.827
Because I am the throne, baby.

263
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:31.966
I am the Bowery!

264
00:37:33.233 --> 00:37:35.566
I am all that you deign
not to look at

265
00:37:35.568 --> 00:37:36.934
when you walk
down the street at night.

266
00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:40.807
The Bowery is mine.
Mine alone.

267
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.675
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

268
00:37:43.677 --> 00:37:47.045
you exist outside
the rules, no men do.

269
00:37:47.047 --> 00:37:48.882
You have seven days.

270
00:39:28.914 --> 00:39:30.284
Enough!

271
00:39:35.889 --> 00:39:38.856
I'm afraid our friend here
is off limits.

272
00:39:38.858 --> 00:39:41.825
But he's Excommunicado.

273
00:39:41.827 --> 00:39:44.364
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

274
00:39:45.898 --> 00:39:47.298
Mr. Jonathan,

275
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.137
would you be so kind
as to come with me?

276
00:40:10.222 --> 00:40:13.391
Welcome to Casablanca,
Mr. Wick.

277
00:40:13.393 --> 00:40:15.396
Thanks.

278
00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:21.465
Mr. Jonathan,

279
00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:23.367
it has been a long time
since our fine city

280
00:40:23.369 --> 00:40:25.172
has been graced
with your presence.

281
00:40:25.838 --> 00:40:27.070
I need to talk to...

282
00:40:27.072 --> 00:40:29.273
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar,
she's expecting you.

283
00:40:36.315 --> 00:40:40.117
My, my, welcome
to the Moroccan Continental.

284
00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:42.021
I hope you'll find it
to your taste.

285
00:40:43.956 --> 00:40:45.222
Right this way.

286
00:40:45.224 --> 00:40:48.094
Ms. Al-Azwar,
she waits for no man.

287
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:56.903
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

288
00:41:31.538 --> 00:41:33.336
You a dog person, John?

289
00:41:33.338 --> 00:41:35.375
Sofia?

290
00:41:40.179 --> 00:41:42.847
Sofia!

291
00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:45.249
You can't kill the bearer
of your marker.

292
00:41:45.251 --> 00:41:48.322
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

293
00:41:49.322 --> 00:41:50.490
Nice suit.

294
00:41:53.126 --> 00:41:54.858
Good to see you, too.

295
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.260
I should shoot you
in the head right now.

296
00:41:57.262 --> 00:41:58.798
I know.

297
00:42:04.036 --> 00:42:06.005
Don't you do it.

298
00:42:07.273 --> 00:42:09.941
You're Excommunicado, John.

299
00:42:09.943 --> 00:42:14.414
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

300
00:42:19.518 --> 00:42:21.521
This is your blood.

301
00:42:22.554 --> 00:42:24.889
Your bond.

302
00:42:24.891 --> 00:42:29.463
When you needed help,
I was there.

303
00:42:37.436 --> 00:42:38.505
Sit.

304
00:42:42.442 --> 00:42:45.012
I was talking to you, John.

305
00:42:49.382 --> 00:42:54.117
You do realize that
I'm management now, right?

306
00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:56.052
I'm not service anymore, John.

307
00:42:56.054 --> 00:42:59.624
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

308
00:42:59.626 --> 00:43:02.260
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

309
00:43:02.262 --> 00:43:04.595
I just need you
to get me to him.

310
00:43:04.597 --> 00:43:07.334
- To who?
- Your old boss.

311
00:43:09.335 --> 00:43:10.934
You want to kill Berrada.

312
00:43:10.936 --> 00:43:12.970
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

313
00:43:12.972 --> 00:43:15.409
What could he
possibly give to you?

314
00:43:18.043 --> 00:43:19.510
Guidance.

315
00:43:19.512 --> 00:43:24.382
Look, I made a deal when
I agreed to run this hotel.

316
00:43:24.384 --> 00:43:25.615
And that deal said

317
00:43:25.617 --> 00:43:28.519
that I had to follow
the rules of the Table.

318
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:31.956
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

319
00:43:31.958 --> 00:43:35.492
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

320
00:43:35.494 --> 00:43:39.232
If I make one mistake,
one enemy...

321
00:43:40.532 --> 00:43:44.103
Maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

322
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.507
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

323
00:43:49.943 --> 00:43:54.114
But that's not a chance
I can take. Sorry.

324
00:43:56.215 --> 00:43:58.418
Do you wanna know
where she is?

325
00:43:59.318 --> 00:44:02.420
No. I don't ever wanna know.

326
00:44:02.422 --> 00:44:05.324
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

327
00:44:06.592 --> 00:44:10.695
A part of me longs for her.

328
00:44:10.697 --> 00:44:14.731
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

329
00:44:14.733 --> 00:44:16.402
just to keep her safe.

330
00:44:19.639 --> 00:44:26.711
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

331
00:44:26.713 --> 00:44:29.512
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

332
00:44:29.514 --> 00:44:31.414
That's why
I'm sitting here right now

333
00:44:31.416 --> 00:44:33.619
and that's why I'm fucked!

334
00:44:39.224 --> 00:44:41.360
- Consequences.
- Yeah.

335
00:44:43.262 --> 00:44:45.132
Consequences.

336
00:44:47.199 --> 00:44:49.302
I'm just asking you to try.

337
00:44:50.369 --> 00:44:52.072
Either way, you and me,

338
00:44:52.605 --> 00:44:54.206
we'll be even.

339
00:45:05.284 --> 00:45:06.519
No.

340
00:45:07.686 --> 00:45:13.359
After this,
we are less than even.

341
00:45:17.362 --> 00:45:19.265
We leave in 10 minutes.

342
00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:17.456
How can I help you?

343
00:46:29.802 --> 00:46:32.305
I wasn't expecting
the High Table so soon.

344
00:46:34.673 --> 00:46:36.673
There is a task.

345
00:46:36.675 --> 00:46:38.809
It involves someone
who broke the rules

346
00:46:38.811 --> 00:46:40.213
and stood against the Table.

347
00:46:41.813 --> 00:46:44.380
John Wick, you mean.

348
00:46:44.382 --> 00:46:46.349
My students
have not been idle.

349
00:46:46.351 --> 00:46:49.586
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

350
00:46:49.588 --> 00:46:51.688
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

351
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.425
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

352
00:46:54.427 --> 00:46:56.762
A dog, a car.

353
00:46:57.697 --> 00:46:58.832
I'm familiar.

354
00:47:02.335 --> 00:47:03.836
And I'm interested.

355
00:47:05.304 --> 00:47:06.440
Very.

356
00:47:12.911 --> 00:47:15.848
Blowfish. Very fatal.

357
00:47:20.719 --> 00:47:21.821
No soy.

358
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:34.201
I have served,
I will be of service.

359
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.902
Stop!

360
00:49:23.541 --> 00:49:24.610
Out!

361
00:49:31.317 --> 00:49:34.651
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

362
00:49:34.653 --> 00:49:37.720
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

363
00:49:37.722 --> 00:49:38.655
He had a ticket.

364
00:49:38.657 --> 00:49:41.525
But a ticket does not stand
above the Table.

365
00:49:41.527 --> 00:49:44.431
Your penance
will be paid in blood.

366
00:49:44.929 --> 00:49:45.931
Now...

367
00:49:48.833 --> 00:49:53.405
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

368
00:50:01.579 --> 00:50:06.853
I have served,
I will be of service.

369
00:50:29.742 --> 00:50:31.745
We're not going in
like the old days.

370
00:50:32.677 --> 00:50:35.112
It's just a conversation.

371
00:50:35.114 --> 00:50:38.985
Nothing's ever just
a conversation with you, John.

372
00:50:42.855 --> 00:50:44.391
Let's go.

373
00:51:08.547 --> 00:51:10.380
Sofia.

374
00:51:10.382 --> 00:51:13.016
Always so nice to see you.

375
00:51:13.018 --> 00:51:16.789
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

376
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:18.921
Certainly.

377
00:51:22.994 --> 00:51:24.864
Fantastic.

378
00:51:25.664 --> 00:51:28.432
Jonathan Wick.

379
00:51:28.434 --> 00:51:31.504
I had heard you had
made your way to our shores.

380
00:51:37.143 --> 00:51:38.976
Come along now.

381
00:51:38.978 --> 00:51:40.947
I am certain
we have much to discuss.

382
00:51:45.617 --> 00:51:49.989
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

383
00:51:51.623 --> 00:51:52.856
Tell me.

384
00:51:52.858 --> 00:51:54.794
Do you come here to kill me?

385
00:51:57.061 --> 00:51:58.364
No.

386
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.744
Mr. Wick, do you know where
the word "assassin" comes from?

387
00:52:13.478 --> 00:52:16.782
People argue. "Assassin."

388
00:52:18.117 --> 00:52:21.921
<i>Hashasheen,</i>
followers of Hassan-i...

389
00:52:23.188 --> 00:52:25.991
Eaters of hashish.

390
00:52:27.525 --> 00:52:28.861
No, thank you.

391
00:52:30.463 --> 00:52:33.796
But others contend
it comes from <i>asasiyyun.</i>

392
00:52:33.798 --> 00:52:36.467
Meaning, "men who are faithful

393
00:52:36.469 --> 00:52:38.070
"and who abide
by their beliefs."

394
00:52:40.005 --> 00:52:42.572
You see that coin?

395
00:52:42.574 --> 00:52:46.008
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

396
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:49.545
Next to it, the first marker.

397
00:52:49.547 --> 00:52:52.014
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

398
00:52:52.016 --> 00:52:53.550
Now, this coin, of course,

399
00:52:53.552 --> 00:52:56.720
it does not represent
monetary value.

400
00:52:56.722 --> 00:52:59.856
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

401
00:52:59.858 --> 00:53:03.128
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

402
00:53:04.262 --> 00:53:05.998
Order and rules.

403
00:53:06.998 --> 00:53:08.965
You have broken the rules.

404
00:53:08.967 --> 00:53:12.135
The High Table
has marked you for death.

405
00:53:12.137 --> 00:53:14.170
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

406
00:53:14.172 --> 00:53:18.143
when your life has been
by your own actions, forfeit?

407
00:53:23.282 --> 00:53:25.151
I seek to make amends.

408
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:28.552
To pay for what I've done.

409
00:53:28.554 --> 00:53:32.090
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

410
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:40.563
This dog,
I do so love it.

411
00:53:40.565 --> 00:53:43.502
Tell me, does it shed
a great deal?

412
00:53:46.137 --> 00:53:48.271
Occasionally.

413
00:53:48.273 --> 00:53:51.708
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

414
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.043
And if he wants me dead...

415
00:53:53.045 --> 00:53:56.648
Then he will see to it that
your bones bleach under the sun.

416
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:59.249
I see.

417
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:01.588
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

418
00:54:08.927 --> 00:54:10.096
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

419
00:54:11.797 --> 00:54:14.000
I cannot tell you
where to find the Elder.

420
00:54:16.936 --> 00:54:18.901
You fail to understand.

421
00:54:18.903 --> 00:54:20.970
The Elder
is not a man you find.

422
00:54:20.972 --> 00:54:23.307
He can only choose
to find you.

423
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:25.309
You wish to speak with him?

424
00:54:25.311 --> 00:54:28.845
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

425
00:54:28.847 --> 00:54:30.280
Canis Minor,

426
00:54:30.282 --> 00:54:33.784
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

427
00:54:33.786 --> 00:54:35.851
You follow the brightest star.

428
00:54:35.853 --> 00:54:38.287
Walk until
you are almost dead.

429
00:54:38.289 --> 00:54:41.057
Then, keep walking.

430
00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:43.126
When you are
on your last breath,

431
00:54:43.128 --> 00:54:47.100
he will find you...
Or he will not.

432
00:54:49.001 --> 00:54:50.637
I am grateful.

433
00:54:53.137 --> 00:54:54.641
Thank you, sir.

434
00:54:57.076 --> 00:54:59.945
Perhaps you were
not listening before.

435
00:55:03.215 --> 00:55:05.151
The social contract.

436
00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:08.054
The commerce of relationships.

437
00:55:09.355 --> 00:55:11.722
You have received
a great gift.

438
00:55:11.724 --> 00:55:12.959
I have hosted your friend.

439
00:55:14.059 --> 00:55:15.929
What do you offer in return?

440
00:55:20.199 --> 00:55:22.902
So soft and yet so fierce.

441
00:55:23.969 --> 00:55:25.972
I love it, this dog.

442
00:55:27.639 --> 00:55:28.838
I will keep it.

443
00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.072
Excuse me?

444
00:55:30.074 --> 00:55:31.907
This will be my gift.

445
00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:34.411
This will be how
you show me your fealty.

446
00:55:34.413 --> 00:55:35.845
No.

447
00:55:35.847 --> 00:55:38.081
Surely it's the least
you can do.

448
00:55:38.083 --> 00:55:40.052
No, you cannot keep my dog.

449
00:55:41.152 --> 00:55:42.688
Very well.

450
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:45.124
Very well.

451
00:55:47.393 --> 00:55:48.992
Then I will kill it.

452
00:55:54.099 --> 00:55:56.066
I'm sorry, Sofia.

453
00:55:56.068 --> 00:55:58.204
This was for you to learn.

454
00:56:06.878 --> 00:56:07.980
Don't.

455
00:56:49.722 --> 00:56:51.858
Sofia. Don't.

456
00:56:56.795 --> 00:56:58.731
He shot my dog.

457
00:56:59.998 --> 00:57:01.398
I get it.

458
00:57:03.434 --> 00:57:05.904
We gotta go. Now.

459
01:03:41.532 --> 01:03:43.068
Here you go.

460
01:03:47.539 --> 01:03:50.340
You're gonna die, John.

461
01:03:50.342 --> 01:03:53.443
Whether out here
in this desert,

462
01:03:53.445 --> 01:03:56.148
or somewhere else
down the road.

463
01:03:57.715 --> 01:03:59.518
But you are gonna die.

464
01:04:14.798 --> 01:04:16.568
Consequences.

465
01:04:20.539 --> 01:04:22.108
Consequences.

466
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.469
Better get going.

467
01:04:59.744 --> 01:05:01.213
Sofia.

468
01:07:42.072 --> 01:07:43.942
Okay.

469
01:07:49.146 --> 01:07:50.915
You made your point.

470
01:07:52.516 --> 01:07:54.385
You have earned my fealty.

471
01:07:55.452 --> 01:07:56.719
Matter of fact...

472
01:07:56.721 --> 01:07:58.621
I'm gonna shove so
much fealty up your ass

473
01:07:58.623 --> 01:08:00.490
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

474
01:08:00.492 --> 01:08:02.657
You had your chance.

475
01:08:02.659 --> 01:08:05.695
Well, since you see it
that way,

476
01:08:05.697 --> 01:08:07.829
I guess it's time I told you

477
01:08:07.831 --> 01:08:11.833
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

478
01:08:11.835 --> 01:08:13.836
Duly noted.

479
01:08:13.838 --> 01:08:15.637
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

480
01:08:15.639 --> 01:08:19.509
your penance will be paid
with seven cuts.

481
01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.014
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

482
01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:28.120
Avert your eyes,
my sweet.

483
01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.957
The king is dead.

484
01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:38.831
Long live the king.

485
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:33.918
Drink.

486
01:09:35.619 --> 01:09:39.690
Don't worry, your weapon
is still there. Please drink.

487
01:09:50.033 --> 01:09:54.135
My son, how have you
come to be so lost?

488
01:09:54.137 --> 01:09:55.606
Not lost.

489
01:09:56.673 --> 01:09:58.139
Looking for you.

490
01:09:58.141 --> 01:10:00.711
You think
I speak of your location?

491
01:10:02.113 --> 01:10:04.146
Never seen a man fight so hard

492
01:10:04.148 --> 01:10:06.150
to end up
back where he started.

493
01:10:13.957 --> 01:10:15.991
So tell me, Jonathan.

494
01:10:15.993 --> 01:10:17.962
Why do you wish to live?

495
01:10:18.695 --> 01:10:21.966
My wife, Helen.

496
01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:29.539
To remember her.
To remember us.

497
01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:32.144
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

498
01:10:33.877 --> 01:10:36.081
At least a chance to earn it.

499
01:10:37.748 --> 01:10:42.018
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

500
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.089
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

501
01:10:45.856 --> 01:10:47.723
Complete a task for us,

502
01:10:47.725 --> 01:10:49.858
and your Excommunicado
will be reversed.

503
01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.061
The open contract closed,

504
01:10:52.063 --> 01:10:54.129
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

505
01:10:54.131 --> 01:10:57.232
Not free under the Table,
but bound to it.

506
01:10:57.234 --> 01:11:00.238
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

507
01:11:04.708 --> 01:11:06.110
The choice is yours.

508
01:11:08.212 --> 01:11:10.646
Die here and now.

509
01:11:10.648 --> 01:11:13.618
Or continue to live
and remember through death.

510
01:11:31.002 --> 01:11:33.001
What must be done?

511
01:11:33.003 --> 01:11:36.104
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

512
01:11:36.106 --> 01:11:38.810
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

513
01:11:39.911 --> 01:11:41.043
What?

514
01:11:41.045 --> 01:11:43.845
He has forgotten his fealty.

515
01:11:43.847 --> 01:11:46.315
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

516
01:11:46.317 --> 01:11:48.987
will be lifted
until you complete your task.

517
01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.620
So if you wish to live,

518
01:11:51.622 --> 01:11:54.357
and if you wish to remember,

519
01:11:54.359 --> 01:11:56.194
this is the choice
you must make.

520
01:12:13.144 --> 01:12:15.146
I will serve.

521
01:12:17.215 --> 01:12:20.281
I will be of service.

522
01:12:20.283 --> 01:12:22.384
Very well, my son.

523
01:12:22.386 --> 01:12:24.387
Cast aside your weakness

524
01:12:24.389 --> 01:12:27.259
and reaffirm your fealty
to the table.

525
01:12:33.398 --> 01:12:34.865
Mr. John Wick.

526
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.900
I want to see. Show me.

527
01:13:22.779 --> 01:13:24.115
Thank you.

528
01:13:25.416 --> 01:13:29.253
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

529
01:13:46.503 --> 01:13:49.405
I wish you good luck
on your path.

530
01:13:49.407 --> 01:13:52.210
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

531
01:13:53.978 --> 01:13:55.146
And Mr. Wick.

532
01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:03.469
Welcome back.

533
01:14:34.851 --> 01:14:38.153
<i>JFK Express
now arriving on platform nine.</i>

534
01:14:38.155 --> 01:14:41.092
<i>JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.</i>

535
01:16:04.007 --> 01:16:05.507
Stick together, kids.

536
01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:06.942
Make sure
you're holding the hand

537
01:16:06.944 --> 01:16:10.048
of the person
in front and behind you.

538
01:16:12.216 --> 01:16:15.520
You see? That's why
you're special, John Wick.

539
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:20.559
I wouldn't have stopped.

540
01:16:22.059 --> 01:16:23.561
It's good to have you back.

541
01:16:30.467 --> 01:16:32.304
How was your trip?

542
01:16:35.038 --> 01:16:37.041
Going to the Continental?

543
01:16:43.146 --> 01:16:44.979
He with you?

544
01:16:44.981 --> 01:16:47.252
He was.

545
01:16:57.395 --> 01:16:59.061
Nice trick.

546
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:09.253
Sir! Put your weapon down.

547
01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.488
He's Excommunicado.

548
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:15.760
Unless you wish
to become the same,

549
01:20:16.726 --> 01:20:20.262
I suggest you lower your gun.

550
01:20:26.237 --> 01:20:28.273
I'd like to see the manager.

551
01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.741
Of course.

552
01:20:32.743 --> 01:20:35.447
If you would be so kind
as to follow me.

553
01:20:48.492 --> 01:20:50.259
Please take a seat.

554
01:20:50.261 --> 01:20:52.430
I will let him know
you have arrived.

555
01:21:27.198 --> 01:21:28.729
I gotta tell you,

556
01:21:28.731 --> 01:21:31.833
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

557
01:21:31.835 --> 01:21:34.872
I'm a huge fan. John Wick.

558
01:21:37.274 --> 01:21:40.278
And so far,
you haven't disappointed.

559
01:21:43.646 --> 01:21:45.813
Is that the dog?

560
01:21:45.815 --> 01:21:48.250
He likes you.

561
01:21:48.252 --> 01:21:52.490
Me? I'm more of
a cat person myself.

562
01:21:52.922 --> 01:21:54.626
Hey, dog.

563
01:21:57.627 --> 01:22:01.796
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

564
01:22:01.798 --> 01:22:03.965
We're not the same.

565
01:22:03.967 --> 01:22:05.502
Yes, we are.

566
01:22:06.337 --> 01:22:08.970
No, we're not.

567
01:22:08.972 --> 01:22:11.540
The manager
is ready for you now.

568
01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:13.311
In the administrative lounge,
sir.

569
01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:26.600
We're both masters of death.

570
01:22:27.858 --> 01:22:29.458
Mr. Wick.

571
01:22:31.561 --> 01:22:32.596
Sit.

572
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:35.399
Stay.

573
01:22:36.699 --> 01:22:37.801
Good dog.

574
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:36.360
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

575
01:23:44.734 --> 01:23:48.402
We only use this room
on special occasions.

576
01:23:48.404 --> 01:23:52.473
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

577
01:23:52.475 --> 01:23:53.942
under the table.

578
01:23:55.878 --> 01:23:58.015
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

579
01:23:59.115 --> 01:24:00.549
Yeah.

580
01:24:00.551 --> 01:24:02.718
Well, of course.

581
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.990
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

582
01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:10.358
Isn't that why you're here?

583
01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.865
I have served,
I will be of service.

584
01:24:16.867 --> 01:24:19.901
But you're having doubts.

585
01:24:19.903 --> 01:24:23.671
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

586
01:24:23.673 --> 01:24:25.643
If you feel you must,

587
01:24:28.045 --> 01:24:30.414
put a bullet through my heart.

588
01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.553
The High Table has asked me
to step down.

589
01:24:39.555 --> 01:24:40.924
The hour?

590
01:24:41.658 --> 01:24:42.691
The hour.

591
01:24:42.693 --> 01:24:45.096
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

592
01:24:46.462 --> 01:24:48.796
Maybe I should have.

593
01:24:48.798 --> 01:24:51.465
Rules and consequences.

594
01:24:51.467 --> 01:24:52.933
Hmm.

595
01:24:52.935 --> 01:24:54.535
It seems like everyone
is suffering

596
01:24:54.537 --> 01:24:56.905
from the consequences
of their actions.

597
01:24:56.907 --> 01:24:59.344
And you're not stepping down?

598
01:25:01.145 --> 01:25:02.680
No.

599
01:25:03.646 --> 01:25:05.613
I don't think I am.

600
01:25:05.615 --> 01:25:07.648
So it's war?

601
01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:09.787
You're going to war
with the High Table?

602
01:25:10.587 --> 01:25:11.919
Skirmish.

603
01:25:11.921 --> 01:25:13.021
Unless you decide to shoot me.

604
01:25:13.023 --> 01:25:16.828
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

605
01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.061
than that of an enemy.

606
01:25:20.063 --> 01:25:22.833
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

607
01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.802
What choice?

608
01:25:26.804 --> 01:25:29.670
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

609
01:25:29.672 --> 01:25:33.842
But I'll be alive.
And I can remember her.

610
01:25:33.844 --> 01:25:36.678
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

611
01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.183
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

612
01:25:41.185 --> 01:25:44.718
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

613
01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.692
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

614
01:25:49.091 --> 01:25:50.925
The Baba Yaga?

615
01:25:50.927 --> 01:25:53.061
The last thing
many men ever see?

616
01:25:53.063 --> 01:25:58.066
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

617
01:25:58.068 --> 01:26:00.771
Who do you wish
to die as, Jonathan?

618
01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:35.903
Mr. Wick,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

619
01:26:35.905 --> 01:26:37.608
I am an Adjudicator.

620
01:26:39.042 --> 01:26:40.845
Have you decided to step down?

621
01:26:43.546 --> 01:26:46.248
I think not.

622
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:49.520
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

623
01:26:52.823 --> 01:26:55.927
No, I don't think I will.

624
01:27:03.734 --> 01:27:04.969
Very well.

625
01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:14.976
Administration.

626
01:27:14.978 --> 01:27:16.980
<i>I'd like to
change a designation.</i>

627
01:27:17.847 --> 01:27:19.013
Verification?

628
01:27:19.015 --> 01:27:22.250
<i>Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.</i>

629
01:27:22.252 --> 01:27:24.318
The Continental Hotel,
New York.

630
01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.254
<i>New designation?</i>

631
01:27:26.256 --> 01:27:27.792
Deconsecrated.

632
01:27:30.661 --> 01:27:31.662
Processing.

633
01:27:34.064 --> 01:27:35.184
<i>Administrator.</i>

634
01:27:36.233 --> 01:27:40.805
<i>File. The New York
Continental Hotel.</i>

635
01:27:51.213 --> 01:27:55.720
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

636
01:28:02.993 --> 01:28:05.626
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

637
01:28:05.628 --> 01:28:08.295
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

638
01:28:08.297 --> 01:28:10.598
Since you are refusing
to step down

639
01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.035
and you are refusing a direct
order, your lives are now forfeit.

640
01:28:15.037 --> 01:28:17.171
High Table emissaries will be
joining you presently

641
01:28:17.173 --> 01:28:19.877
to see the removal of
your souls from the property.

642
01:28:21.078 --> 01:28:23.080
Good evening, gentlemen.

643
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:30.554
This haven is safe no more.

644
01:28:33.222 --> 01:28:35.993
Are services
still off limits to me?

645
01:28:36.827 --> 01:28:38.125
Under the circumstances,

646
01:28:38.127 --> 01:28:40.195
your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

647
01:28:40.197 --> 01:28:41.699
What do you need?

648
01:28:42.198 --> 01:28:45.635
Guns. Lots of guns.

649
01:29:03.819 --> 01:29:05.822
Let's make a withdrawal.

650
01:29:29.912 --> 01:29:31.312
Remember, sir.

651
01:29:31.314 --> 01:29:33.882
These will be
High Table forces.

652
01:29:33.884 --> 01:29:36.252
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

653
01:29:36.953 --> 01:29:38.186
Why?

654
01:29:38.188 --> 01:29:39.923
Much has changed
during your time away.

655
01:29:40.756 --> 01:29:41.856
Like what?

656
01:29:41.858 --> 01:29:44.795
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

657
01:29:52.802 --> 01:29:56.737
May I suggest
the 2011 Combat Master

658
01:29:56.739 --> 01:29:58.975
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

659
01:30:10.453 --> 01:30:12.253
<i>Attention, all guests.</i>

660
01:30:12.255 --> 01:30:15.857
<i>The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.</i>

661
01:30:15.859 --> 01:30:17.491
<i>We apologize
for the inconvenience.</i>

662
01:30:17.493 --> 01:30:19.663
<i>Please make your way
to the nearest exit.</i>

663
01:30:24.266 --> 01:30:27.102
<i>Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...</i>

664
01:30:27.104 --> 01:30:30.804
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

665
01:30:30.806 --> 01:30:32.339
Your transaction
may now be conducted

666
01:30:32.341 --> 01:30:34.045
on Continental grounds.

667
01:30:39.882 --> 01:30:43.084
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

668
01:30:43.086 --> 01:30:46.056
Cool. Very cool.

669
01:30:50.926 --> 01:30:55.863
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second.

670
01:30:55.865 --> 01:30:57.768
Serious business.

671
01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:02.336
Thank you.

672
01:31:02.338 --> 01:31:04.007
Let us begin.

673
01:32:50.313 --> 01:32:53.184
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

674
01:32:54.083 --> 01:32:55.586
Of course, sir.

675
01:33:16.972 --> 01:33:19.641
I know you'll do
the Continental proud.

676
01:33:19.643 --> 01:33:21.311
I'll see you soon, sir.

677
01:33:24.314 --> 01:33:27.982
And you, Jonathan,
do what you do best.

678
01:33:27.984 --> 01:33:29.153
What's that?

679
01:33:29.685 --> 01:33:31.287
Hunt.

680
01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:46.786
If you want peace...

681
01:33:49.787 --> 01:33:51.700
Prepare for war.

682
01:37:04.734 --> 01:37:08.172
Winston! Winston!

683
01:37:12.274 --> 01:37:14.709
I need more firepower.

684
01:37:37.432 --> 01:37:39.400
Armor improvements.

685
01:37:39.402 --> 01:37:42.439
12-gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

686
01:41:06.626 --> 01:41:08.900
No one kills you but me.

687
01:41:09.845 --> 01:41:11.914
Only by my sword, John.

688
01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:26.527
<i>I know you
believe you can keep this up.</i>

689
01:41:26.529 --> 01:41:27.727
<i>But I assure you...</i>

690
01:45:29.722 --> 01:45:33.958
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Wick.

691
01:45:34.959 --> 01:45:37.100
It's an honor to fight with you, Mr. Wick.

692
01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.100
He is getting slow.

693
01:46:10.101 --> 01:46:12.600
He is been retired for 5 years.

694
01:46:12.601 --> 01:46:16.000
But he is still... John Wick.

695
01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.800
We will see.

696
01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:03.302
Be seeing you.

697
01:49:32.948 --> 01:49:35.485
John, you're incredible.

698
01:49:36.417 --> 01:49:37.487
Exhausted,

699
01:49:38.087 --> 01:49:40.019
outnumbered...

700
01:49:40.021 --> 01:49:41.323
Obviously in pain.

701
01:49:42.524 --> 01:49:45.224
And you still beat
all of my students.

702
01:49:45.226 --> 01:49:47.130
If I didn't
have to kill you,

703
01:49:47.662 --> 01:49:50.165
we'd be pals.

704
01:49:50.632 --> 01:49:52.268
Let's do this.

705
01:50:20.029 --> 01:50:22.532
See? We're the same.

706
01:54:09.323 --> 01:54:11.892
I would like to suggest
a parley.

707
01:54:11.894 --> 01:54:13.626
A parley would be good.

708
01:54:13.628 --> 01:54:15.097
<i>Very well.</i>

709
01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.777
Are we in play, sir?

710
01:54:29.511 --> 01:54:30.780
Oh, very much so.

711
01:54:50.399 --> 01:54:51.901
Hey, John.

712
01:54:54.336 --> 01:54:56.672
That was
a pretty good fight, huh?

713
01:55:00.542 --> 01:55:01.744
Yeah.

714
01:55:31.372 --> 01:55:33.339
Yeah.

715
01:55:33.341 --> 01:55:36.809
Don't worry about me, John.

716
01:55:36.811 --> 01:55:38.914
I just gotta catch my breath.

717
01:55:40.815 --> 01:55:42.551
I'll catch up to you, John.

718
01:55:47.756 --> 01:55:49.692
No, you won't.

719
01:56:00.402 --> 01:56:01.468
You gentlemen, of course,

720
01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:03.736
realize that was
the first wave.

721
01:56:03.738 --> 01:56:06.339
Merely an amuse-bouche.

722
01:56:06.341 --> 01:56:07.874
We can keep this up
as long as you'd like,

723
01:56:07.876 --> 01:56:09.675
but it only ends one way.

724
01:56:09.677 --> 01:56:12.344
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

725
01:56:12.346 --> 01:56:14.613
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

726
01:56:14.615 --> 01:56:15.848
Oh, you can take
the Continental,

727
01:56:15.850 --> 01:56:16.884
I have no doubt about that.

728
01:56:16.886 --> 01:56:19.552
But keeping it, that's
a different matter entirely.

729
01:56:19.554 --> 01:56:22.692
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

730
01:56:23.591 --> 01:56:25.293
We are High Table.

731
01:56:25.793 --> 01:56:27.229
And we

732
01:56:28.363 --> 01:56:29.966
are New York City.

733
01:56:30.998 --> 01:56:32.702
Are we negotiating?

734
01:56:34.735 --> 01:56:35.770
Hmm.

735
01:56:36.505 --> 01:56:37.840
I believe we are.

736
01:56:43.645 --> 01:56:44.647
Parley?

737
01:56:45.579 --> 01:56:46.849
Parley.

738
01:56:50.452 --> 01:56:52.555
What do you propose we do?

739
01:56:56.692 --> 01:56:58.627
Let me keep my power.

740
01:56:59.094 --> 01:57:00.395
Under the Table.

741
01:57:03.364 --> 01:57:04.897
I have served

742
01:57:04.899 --> 01:57:07.834
and been a beacon
of order and stability

743
01:57:07.836 --> 01:57:09.968
to our industry
for over 40 years.

744
01:57:09.970 --> 01:57:12.571
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped

745
01:57:12.573 --> 01:57:15.478
and re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

746
01:57:17.813 --> 01:57:19.414
Winston.

747
01:57:24.953 --> 01:57:26.686
You were
merely showing strength

748
01:57:26.688 --> 01:57:29.292
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

749
01:57:32.761 --> 01:57:35.698
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

750
01:57:36.965 --> 01:57:38.434
But what about him?

751
01:57:40.569 --> 01:57:44.006
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

752
01:57:49.578 --> 01:57:51.347
Oh, he has to die.

753
01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.714
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

754
01:57:54.716 --> 01:57:55.982
Don't see any other way.

755
01:58:07.863 --> 01:58:09.696
Very well, gentlemen.

756
01:58:09.698 --> 01:58:12.902
The Continental will now
be reconsecrated.

757
01:58:13.868 --> 01:58:15.737
Good day to you both.

758
01:58:19.774 --> 01:58:21.476
Well played, sir.

759
01:58:56.778 --> 01:58:59.778
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

760
01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:01.550
Oh, should be no time at all.

761
01:59:05.554 --> 01:59:07.454
Mr. Wick is gone.

762
01:59:07.456 --> 01:59:09.155
A true tragedy.

763
01:59:09.157 --> 01:59:10.723
You misunderstand.

764
01:59:10.725 --> 01:59:13.726
I mean that he is no longer
on the street.

765
01:59:13.728 --> 01:59:14.893
That seems improbable.

766
01:59:14.895 --> 01:59:16.228
And yet, true.

767
01:59:17.698 --> 01:59:20.666
<i>I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.</i>

768
01:59:20.668 --> 01:59:22.936
<i>Both from above and below.</i>

769
01:59:22.938 --> 01:59:24.670
The last thing
either one of us needs

770
01:59:24.672 --> 01:59:26.908
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

771
01:59:29.845 --> 01:59:31.844
<i>For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it</i>

772
01:59:31.846 --> 01:59:34.112
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

773
01:59:34.114 --> 01:59:37.819
Absolutely.
How far can he get?

774
01:59:49.631 --> 01:59:50.966
Baba Yaga.

775
02:00:03.744 --> 02:00:04.846
Mmm.

776
02:00:22.264 --> 02:00:24.796
How you doing, John?

777
02:00:24.798 --> 02:00:27.536
You look as bad as I feel.

778
02:00:29.237 --> 02:00:32.104
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

779
02:00:32.106 --> 02:00:34.577
Raise a hand
if you can hear me, John.

780
02:00:37.177 --> 02:00:40.112
Oh, shit.
They took a finger.

781
02:00:40.114 --> 02:00:42.717
Ain't that a bitch?

782
02:00:48.155 --> 02:00:52.157
Oh, John fucking Wick.

783
02:00:52.159 --> 02:00:54.861
So, the old boy
keeps his hotel

784
02:00:54.863 --> 02:00:56.262
and you take the fall.

785
02:00:56.264 --> 02:00:57.397
Can't say I blame him.

786
02:00:57.399 --> 02:00:59.902
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

787
02:01:00.835 --> 02:01:03.605
But this High Table shit...

788
02:01:06.608 --> 02:01:08.210
Seven cuts.

789
02:01:11.845 --> 02:01:14.582
Under the Table
is where shit gets done.

790
02:01:16.283 --> 02:01:19.318
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

791
02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:21.724
you better cut him
to the quick.

792
02:01:26.226 --> 02:01:27.729
So...

793
02:01:30.230 --> 02:01:32.001
Let me ask you, John.

794
02:01:32.667 --> 02:01:33.702
How do you feel?

795
02:01:36.203 --> 02:01:40.643
'Cause I am really pissed off.

796
02:01:41.275 --> 02:01:43.241
You pissed, John?

797
02:01:43.243 --> 02:01:44.710
Hmm?

798
02:01:44.712 --> 02:01:45.813
Are you?

799
02:01:55.657 --> 02:01:57.259
Yeah.
